		<h1>Mansion Escape</h1>
		<h2>Basement</h2>
		
		<p>As you ring the doorbell the floor opens up below and you fall into a dimly lit basement. You hear noises coming from all around you
			It sounds like scratching and low-pitched whaling. You see sheets everywhere with one at the end of the basement that looks like it's 
			covering a body. After getting your bearings you stand up, fearful of what you have discovered.</p>
		<p>Player, what will you do?</p>
