		<h2>Basement - Battle</h2>
		
		<p>As you walk through the basement, slowly getting closer to the sheet you see that it's not covering something normal. The basement
			has become silent. As you grab the sheet and pull it away, you're horrified to see a mutated creature laying before you, it opens its
			one eye and stands up towering over you as you fall to the ground and the lights come on.</p>
		<p>Player, what will you do?</p>
