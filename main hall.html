		<h1>Mansion Escape</h1>
		<h2>Main Hall</h2>
		
		<p>You barge your way into the main hall, you look around and can faintly see a destroyed staircase in the middle of the room but it's hard to make out
			due to the room being so dark. You also notice all the doors have been boarded up and the building is ready to collapse with how run down it is. You can't
			see anything of note in the main hall.</p>
		<p>Player, What will you do?</p>
