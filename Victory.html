		<h1>Mansion Escape</h1>
		<h2>Congratulations</h2>
		
		<p>As the monster towers over you it swings its huge mutated arms around wildly causing sparks to fly everywhere.
			You realise you're laying in a pool of gasoline, so you run like hell as the sparks ignite behind you. As your running 
			you look back and see the other sheets burning away revealing prototypes of the mutant all in different shapes and forms.
			You sprint up the stares at the opposite end of the basement and burst out into the main hall, fleeing for your life.</p>
		<p>You escape the mansion running out the front gates as you turn and see it going up in flames. you know no one will
			believe what you saw that night and now all evidence was gone but you're glad to still have your life.</p>
